# PR2-Additions
SSU sequences for red algal species in the Bay of Fundy, to supplement public PR2 database. 
These sequences are currently unpublished. I will update the reposity once the paper has been published. I also intend to upload these sequences to GenBank/BOLD eventually; this repository is meant for the interim, for those interested to have a look at the sequences. 
The sequences have been checked for quality and edited using Geneious, and are taxonomically up-to-date as of January 2023. 

The SSU region (1800 bp) was PCR amplified using external primers G01 (5’-CACCTGGTTGATCCTGCCAG-3’; forward) and G07 (5’-AGCTTGATCCTTCTGCAGGTTCACCTAC-3’; reverse) and sequenced with two external and two internal primers G04 (5’-CAGAGGTGAAATTCTTGGAT-3’) and G14 (5’-CCTTGGCAGACGCTTTCGCAG-3’) (Saunders & Moore 2013). The thermal profile for PCR amplification of the SSU includes an initial denaturation at 94°C, 38 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C annealing for 30 s, and 72°C extension for 90 s, and a 72°C final extension for 7 min (Saunders & Moore 2013). 

Primers were designed by G. W. Saunders, PCR amplified by J. Crichton, Sanger Sequenced at Genome Quebec.
